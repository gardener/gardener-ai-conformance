# DRA Support Conformance Test

## What is Being Tested

**Requirement**: Support Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) APIs to enable more flexible and fine-grained resource requests beyond simple counts.

## How We Tested It

Verified that the `resource.k8s.io` API group is available with the required DRA resource types (deviceclasses, resourceclaims, resourceclaimtemplates, resourceslices).

## Result

âœ… **PASS (Partially Implemented)** - DRA APIs available at `resource.k8s.io/v1beta1` in Kubernetes v1.33. The GA version (`v1`) is expected in v1.34 or later.
