# Robust Controller Test

## What is Being Tested

**Requirement**: The platform must prove that at least one complex AI operator with a CRD (e.g., Ray, Kubeflow) can be installed and functions reliably. This includes verifying that the operator's pods run correctly, its webhooks are operational, and its custom resources can be reconciled.

## How We Tested It

Installed KubeRay operator v1.3.0, verified CRDs were registered (RayCluster, RayJob, RayService), tested webhook validation by submitting an invalid RayCluster spec (correctly rejected), created a valid RayCluster that reconciled to ready state, and executed distributed Ray tasks to confirm functionality.

## Result

âœ… **PASS** - KubeRay operator functions correctly with full CRD lifecycle management, webhook validation, and workload execution.
