# AI Inference Gateway API Support

## What is Being Tested

**Requirement**: Support the Kubernetes Gateway API with an implementation for advanced traffic management for inference services, which enables capabilities like weighted traffic splitting, header-based routing (for OpenAI protocol headers), and optional integration with service meshes.

## How We Tested It

Installed Gateway API v1.2.1 CRDs and Traefik gateway controller, then created a GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute with weighted traffic splitting (70/30) and header-based routing. Verified all resources were accepted and functional.

## Result

âœ… **PASS** - Gateway API v1 resources available and functional with advanced traffic management features.
