MUST: For supported accelerator types, the platform must allow for the installation and successful operation of at least one accelerator metrics solution that exposes fine-grained performance metrics via a standardized, machine-readable metrics endpoint. This must include a core set of metrics for per-accelerator utilization and memory usage. Additionally, other relevant metrics such as temperature, power draw, and interconnect bandwidth should be exposed if the underlying hardware or virtualization layer makes them available. The list of metrics should align with emerging standards, such as OpenTelemetry metrics, to ensure interoperability. The platform may provide a managed solution, but this is not required for conformance.

How we might test it: Given a node with a supported accelerator type, identify the Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint for the accelerators on the node and scrape metrics from the endpoint. Parse the scraped metrics to find metrics for each supported accelerator on the node, including: accelerator utilization, memory usage, temperature, power usage, etc. The test can evolve to check for specific metric names once those are standardized.
