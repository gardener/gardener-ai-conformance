# Secure Accelerator Access Conformance Test

## What is Being Tested

**Requirement**: Ensure that access to accelerators from within containers is properly isolated and mediated by the Kubernetes resource management framework (device plugin or DRA) and container runtime, preventing unauthorized access or interference between workloads.

## How We Tested It

**Test 1**: Deployed a pod without GPU resource requests to a GPU node. Verified it cannot access GPU devices (`/dev/nvidia*` not present).

**Test 2**: Deployed 2 pods each requesting 1 GPU. Verified each pod received a different GPU (different UUIDs), could only see exactly 1 GPU via nvidia-smi, and could not access unauthorized GPU device files.

## Result

âœ… **PASS** - GPU access properly isolated and mediated by Kubernetes device plugin and container runtime.
