# Gang Scheduling Conformance Test

## What is Being Tested

**Requirement**: The platform must allow for the installation and successful operation of at least one gang scheduling solution that ensures all-or-nothing scheduling for distributed AI workloads (e.g. Kueue, Volcano, etc.)

## How We Tested It

Installed Kueue v0.14.2 gang scheduling solution, configured resource quotas, and submitted a multi-pod job requiring 3 pods to run in parallel. Verified Kueue admitted the job and all 3 pods were scheduled atomically (all-or-nothing).

## Result

âœ… **PASS** - Kueue successfully installed and provided gang scheduling functionality for distributed workloads.
