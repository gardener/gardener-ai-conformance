MUST: The platform must prove that at least one complex AI operator with a CRD (e.g., Ray, Kubeflow) can be installed and functions reliably. This includes verifying that the operator's pods run correctly, its webhooks are operational, and its custom resources can be reconciled.

How we might test it: Deploy a representative AI operator, verify all Pods of the operator and its webhook are Running and its CRDs are registered with the API server. Verify that invalid attempts (e.g. invalid spec) should be rejected by its admission webhook. Verify that a valid instance of the custom resource can be reconciled.
